# React based To-Do List

![react_to_do_img](http://localhost:3001/static/media/react_note_demo.3abb604d.gif)

## ✏️Description
This is a simple to do list using React and Firebase, which enables users to add notes and remove those. <br>
Since it uses Firebase the data will be preserved even if it is refleshed. It is intuitive design and easy to manipulate. <br>
I posted an article on Medium about what I struggled creating this app.<br>
